Encoding-FixLatin

Converts mixed encoding input UTF-8 output.

Most encoding conversion tools take input in one encoding and produce output in
another encoding.  This module takes input which may contain characters in more
than one encoding (specifically, a mixture of ASCII, ISO8859-1, CP1252 and
UTF-8) and makes a best effort to produce UTF-8 output.

This module is pure Perl and requires at least Perl version 5.8.

No other CPAN modules are required.
